# Aggregate and Window Functions
## Overview
In this project, I used SQL to analyze a sales dataset from a retail company. The dataset contained information about sales transactions, including the date of the transaction, the product sold, and the price. The goal of the project was to use aggregate and window functions in SQL to calculate key metrics and insights about the company's sales performance.
